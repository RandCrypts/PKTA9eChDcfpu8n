<b>Welcome</b>

Just wanted to say, that you are doing an great Job with back tracking the Network traffic (or decompiling the sample) :)
Hope you had a bit fun while doing it. Im not that expirienced in Obfuscating, encrypting and stuff like that, and that is my first big "operation". Lmk how hard it was to find all stuff, deobfuscating it and analysing it ;)
